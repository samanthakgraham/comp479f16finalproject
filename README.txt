This project uses the WebSphinx crawler to crawl a predefined set of links. These pages are then indexed using Python to calculate the tf-idf weights for each term. Finally, a sentiment analysis is performed using the aFinn library (https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn)

Usage:

1. Use WebSphinx GUI to crawl the URL's of your choice.
2. Run python indexer.py. Note that it requires Python 2.7 to run.
3. ???
4. Profit.
